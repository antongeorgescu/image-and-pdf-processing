Image classification with Machine Learning models
-

* **Neural networks** and **classification algorithms** are both methods for image classification, but they have different characteristics and advantages. Here is a summary of the differences between them
<br/>
* **Neural networks** are a type of machine learning model that can learn complex patterns and features from data, such as images. They consist of *multiple layers of interconnected nodes* that perform mathematical operations on the input and output signals.
Neural networks can adapt to different tasks by adjusting the weights of the connections between nodes during training.
Neural networks are especially good at handling high-dimensional and nonlinear data, such as images, because they can capture the spatial and semantic information in the images.<br/>
*In a nutshell a neural networks is a very complex function that has tons of variables, with an equal number of weights, and one or more outputs.*
<br/>
* **Classification algorithms** are a type of machine learning model that can assign a label to an input based on some predefined rules or criteria. They can be divided into two categories: *supervised* and *unsupervised*. **Supervised classification** algorithms use labeled data to learn the rules or criteria for assigning labels, such as decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, etc. **Unsupervised classification** algorithms do not use labeled data, but instead group the inputs into clusters based on some similarity measure, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.
*Classification algorithms are good at handling low-dimensional and linear data, such as numerical or categorical features*.
<br/>
* The main difference between neural networks and classification algorithms is that neural networks can learn the features from the data automatically, while classification algorithms rely on predefined or handcrafted features. This means that neural networks can achieve better performance and generalization on image classification tasks, because they can extract more relevant and robust features from the images. However, neural networks also have some drawbacks, such as requiring more computational resources, more training data, more hyperparameters tuning, and being more prone to overfitting¹²³⁴.
